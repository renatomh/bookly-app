# FastAPI Beyond CRUD

## üí° Project's Idea

This project was developed to create a REST API for a book review web service, using FastAPI.

## üîç Features

-

## üõ† Technologies

During the development of this project, the following techologies were used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)
- [Alembic (Migrations)](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
- [SQLAlchemy (ORM)](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- [Black Formatter](https://github.com/psf/black)

## üíª Project Configuration

Note: the project was developed with Python version **3.9.13**.

### First, create a new virtual environment on the root directory

```bash
$ python -m venv env
```

### Activate the created virtual environment

```bash
$ .\env\Scripts\activate # On Windows machines
$ source ./env/bin/activate # On MacOS/Unix machines
```

### Install the required packages/libs

```bash
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating config files

Create an _.env_ file on the root directory, with all needed variables, credentials and API keys, according to the sample provided (_[example.env](./example.env)_).

### Setting up the databases

Run the command below to create the PostgreSQL and Redis databases locally in your machine (you should have Docker installed, there's also a Make command for that):

```bash
make postgresql
make redis
```

## üíæ Database Migrations

Once the SQL server is ready and the required credentials to access it are present in the _.env_ file, you can run the migrations with the command:

```bash
(env) $ alembic upgrade head
```

You can also downgrade the migrations with the following command:

```bash
(env) $ alembic downgrade base
```

Alternatively, you can migrate up or down by a specific number of revision, or to a specific revision:

```bash
(env) $ alembic upgrade +2 # Migrating up 2 revisions
(env) $ alembic downgrade -1 # Migrating down 1 revision
(env) $ alembic upgrade db9257fac0e2 # Migrating to a specific revision
```

To generate new revisions for the migrations, when there are changes to the application models or new ones are created, you should import any new models in the [migrations/env.py](./migrations/env.py#L12) file, and then run the command below (where you can provide a custom short description for the update):

```bash
(env) $ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "revision description"
```

## ‚èØÔ∏è Running

To run the project in a development environment, execute the following command on the root directory, with the virtual environment activated.

```bash
(env) $ make dev
```

In order to leave the virtual environment, you can simply execute the command below:

```bash
(env) $ deactivate
```
